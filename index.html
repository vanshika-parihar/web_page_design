                    Crime in the United States has been recorded since colonization. Crime rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1900, reaching a broad bulging peak between 
		            the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly and remains moderate at best nationwide, with such crime rates continuing such a decline to this 
		            day. Since 1994 crime rates have steadily decreased, before rising up after 2015 until 2018. From 2018 to 2019, crime rates have recontinued at a steady decline. Statistics
		            on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime Victimization Surveys by the 
		            Bureau of Justice Statistics. In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law 
		            enforcement in the United States. The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American law enforcement agencies. According to the FBI, index
		            crime in the United States includes violent crime and property crime. Violent crime consists of five criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery,
		            aggravated assault, and gang violence; property crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.

                <h2 class="sunheading">Purpose of this Site.</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Since 1930, the FBI has been collecting data on the types, amounts, and impact of crime in the United States through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. This program is 
                    the most reliable source of crime statistics for law enforcement administration, operation, and management. It is also used by researchers, politicians, and criminal 
                    justice professionals to gain a deeper understanding of crime and society. The purpose of this site is to get a closer look at how crime statistics are used and why 
                    they are important.
